Original script posted on <https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/91918-list-open-windows-to-quickly-select-and-close-them/>

Lists visible windows in a searchable listview, from where you can activate or close them.

Text from the original thread:
> Sometimes I open a window for something, but don't close it. After some iterations of this, the alt-tab dialog is a mess, and I want to close several windows at once.
> This script lists all open windows, and allows you to quickly see what you don't need open anymore. You can select all windows of the same process, or class, and close them (...)


Press:
- Ctrl+c to select all matching the class of first selected
- Ctrl+p to select all matching the process of first selected
- Ctrl+d to close all selected
- Enter to activate all selected
